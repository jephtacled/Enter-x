            <p>Welcome to ENTER-X. By accessing this website, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions.</p>

            <h3>1. Purpose of Service</h3>
            <p>ENTER-X is a business directory platform. We facilitate connections between student entrepreneurs and potential clients. ENTER-X does not provide the services listed directly and is not an agent for any business listed.</p>

            <h3>3. Business Listings</h3>
            <p>While we strive to verify student entrepreneurs, ENTER-X does not guarantee the accuracy of every listing. We reserve the right to remove any business that violates our community standards or provides fraudulent information.</p>

            <h3>4. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>ENTER-X shall not be held liable for any disputes, losses, or damages resulting from interactions or transactions between users and businesses listed on this directory.</p>

            <h3>5. Content Ownership</h3>
            <p>All brand names and images used in the directory remain the property of their respective owners. The design and layout of ENTER-X are the intellectual property of the site administrators.</p>

            <h3>6. Changes to Terms</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the site signifies your acceptance of any updated terms.</p>
